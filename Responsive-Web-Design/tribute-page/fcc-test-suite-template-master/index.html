      <p>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela 
        (/mænˈdɛlə/;[1] Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂ːla]; 
        18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a 
        South African anti-apartheid activist and politician 
        who served as the first president of South Africa 
        from 1994 to 1999. 
        He was the country's first black head of state 
        and the first elected in a fully representative 
        democratic election. His government focused on 
        dismantling the legacy of apartheid by 
        fostering racial reconciliation.
        <br> <br>
        Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, 
        he served as the president of the African National 
        Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.</p>
      <h4>Here's a time line of Mandela's life:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1918–1934: Childhood, with both his parents illiterate, 
          Mandela's mother, being a devout Christian, sent him to a 
          local Methodist school when he was about seven. </li>
        <li>1934–1940: Clarkebury, Healdtown, and Fort Hare; 
          In 1939, with Jongintaba's backing, 
          Mandela began work on a BA degree at the University 
          of Fort Hare, an elite black institution of approximately 150 students 
          in Alice, Eastern Cape. He studied English, anthropology, politics, 
          "native administration", and Roman Dutch law in his first year, 
          desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the Native Affairs Department.
          <br>
          at the end of his first year became involved 
          in a students' representative council (SRC) 
          boycott against the quality of food, for which 
          he was suspended from the university; 
          he never returned to complete his degree.</li>
        <li>1941–1943: Arriving in Johannesburg; 
          To continue his higher education, Mandela 
          signed up to a University of South Africa 
          correspondence course, working on his bachelor's degree at night.[
          </br>
          After he passed his BA exams in early 1943, 
          Mandela returned to Johannesburg to follow a political 
          path as a lawyer rather than become a privy councillor 
          in Thembuland.[50] He later stated that he experienced 
          no epiphany, but that he "simply found [himself] doing so, 
          and could not do otherwise."
          </li>
        <li>1943–1949: Law studies and the ANC Youth League; 
          Mandela began studying law at the University of 
          the Witwatersrand, where he was the only 
          black African student and faced racism. There, he 
          befriended liberal and communist European, 
          Jewish and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo 
          and Ruth First.[52] Becoming increasingly 
          politicised, Mandela marched in August 1943 in 
          support of a successful bus boycott to reverse 
          fare rises.[53] Joining the ANC, he was 
          increasingly influenced by Sisulu, spending time 
          with other activists at Sisulu's Orlando house, 
          including his old friend Oliver Tambo.
          <br>
          Mandela met Evelyn Mase, a trainee nurse and ANC activist from Engcobo, 
          Transkei they got married in October 1944.
        </li>
        <li>1962–1964: Arrest and Rivonia trial; 
          On 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along 
          with fellow activist Cecil Williams near Howick.
          <br>
          His hearing began in October, but he disrupted proceedings 
          by wearing a traditional kaross, refusing to call any witnesses, 
          and turning his plea of mitigation into a political speech. 
          Found guilty, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment; 
          <br>
          On 12 June 1964, justice De Wet found Mandela and 
          two of his co-accused guilty on all four charges; 
          although the prosecution had called for the death sentence to be applied, 
          the judge instead condemned them to life imprisonment
        </li>
        <li>1964–1982: In 1964, Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria to the prison on Robben Island, 
          remaining there for the next 18 years. 
          He was initially classified as the lowest grade 
          of prisoner, Class D, meaning that he was 
          permitted one visit and one letter every six months, 
          although all mail was heavily censored. 
          <br>
          Mandela was transferred to 2 other prisons :
          <ul>
            <li>Pollsmoor Prison (1982–1988)</li>
            <li>Victor Verster Prison and release (1988–1990)</li>
          </ul>
          President De Clerk, in February 1990 announced Mandela's unconditional release.[199][200] Shortly thereafter, for the first time in 20 years, photographs of 
          Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa.
        </li>
        <li>1994–1999: Presidency of South Africa
          The newly elected National Assembly's first act 
          was to formally elect Mandela as South Africa's 
          first black chief executive. 
          His inauguration took place in Pretoria on 10 May 1994.
